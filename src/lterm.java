  /* I've been hacking a bit with acceptable forms for the length-energy term.
   * _Nanosystems_ lists one simple expression with a square and cubic term
   * for close distances, and various kinds of exponential expressions for
   * farther away. But these depend on numbers called De and beta and I don't
   * have tables for those (just the few examples in _Nanosystems_). So after
   * some puttering and graphing and algebra, I came up with the following.
   * Energies are in attojoules (10^-18 joules), distances are in angstroms
   * (10^-10 m), forces are in attojoules per angstrom (10^-8 N), and
   * spring constants are in attojoules per angstrom-squared (100 N/m). This
   * is consistent with the units in _Nanosystems_, and also the units used
   * in the 'mm2.prm' parameter file I found on Jay Ponder's ftp site.
   * Expressions for energy and force, where ks and r0 are a function of
   * the two atoms involved:
   *
   *   dr = r - r0;
   *
   * Energy (r) :=
   *   if (dr < rthresh)
   *     { return 0.5 * ks * dr * dr * (1 - kc * dr) - z * ks; }
   *   else
   *     { return (-a * ks / beta) * exp (-beta * dr); }
   *
   * Force (r) :=
   *   if (dr < rthresh)
   *     { return -(ks * dr * (1 - 1.5 * kc * dr)); }
   *   else
   *     { return -a * ks * exp (-beta * dr); }
   *
   *
   * A, beta, z, kcubic, and rthresh are defined below. Notice my use of
   * 'beta' differs from the use in _Nanosystems_, but plays a similar role.
   *
   * These follow Drexler's quadratic-cubic form for dr < rthresh, and for
   * dr > rthresh, they follow an exponential drop-off which is pretty
   * continuous for both energy and force. The only point that I think would
   * be worth quibbling over would be the value of beta, which I picked so
   * that it would look "reasonable" on a graph.
