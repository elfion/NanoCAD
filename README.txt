This is NanoCAD by Will ware, taken from some old website.
It's slightly touched by myself to have more useful GUI (repaint)
It works under modern JVMS.
Found it here: http://server.ccl.net/cca/software/SOURCES/JAVA/ncad/unpacked/ncad.html
Maybe sometime it will be of historical interest.
Also, I found source code very understandable.
